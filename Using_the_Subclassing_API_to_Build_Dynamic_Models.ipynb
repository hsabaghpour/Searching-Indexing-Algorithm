        "The Subclassing API in Keras allows you to build dynamic models in a more flexible and imperative programming style. Instead of declaring the model's architecture, you create it by defining layers and computations in a subclass of the Model class. This approach is useful for complex models with loops, varying shapes, and other dynamic behaviors. It's a more hands-on way of building models compared to the declarative Sequential and Functional APIs.\n",
